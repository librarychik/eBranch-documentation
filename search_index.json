We value plain language, simple and intuitive layouts, and accessible tools and resources in every sense of the word. Our focus is end users: students, faculty, staff, SFU administrators, and the general public. In practice this includes supporting web authors as well. The eBranch is an important link between public services and &gt; technical processes. Some of the partners we work with most &gt; closely: Public services: Liaison librarians, SLC, RC, L &amp; I, Loans, &gt; Belzberg and Fraser locations. Management office, including Graphics.

The eBranch is responsible for the hours tool reflecting our &gt; hours during an emergency or snow closure. Wait to hear from the UL or an ADL before making changes to the &gt; hours tool or, if you think it a good idea, adding in an &gt; emergency message. Don’t make changes based on what SFU University &gt; Communications states as their messaging can be ambiguous and we &gt; don’t wish to erroneously declare a library closed or its hours &gt; truncated. Whoever sees a communication about changed campus hours first should &gt; make the appropriate changes to the hours tool and let all of us &gt; eBranch staff know that you’re doing it so only one person is &gt; updating hours at one time. Responding to crises—e.g. a bug happens. We are here to test, &gt; test report, and communicate both ways Try to replicate the problem Acknowledge the issue – let the person know you are going to work &gt; on it. Ask them to step away so that we can work on it (i.e. they &gt; must stop editing the problem page) Once you have a decent test or understand the problem, report it, &gt; usually to Todd (or Kurt if it’s a server issue). When in doubt, &gt; try lib-sys. It is better to report than not to report. Status updates to the person who initially reported the problem. Repeat as necessary. Communicating in emergency situations—e.g. server down Wait a couple of minutes. Often the issue is temporary and will fix &gt; itself. E-mail lib-sys to let them know about the problem. Mark as URGENT. Communicating in (semi) emergency situations—Library Search, &gt; Catalogue not working Create a News &amp; Events item describing the problem, e.g. Library &gt; Search is experiencing difficulties…. \\[temporary solution\\]… &gt; We are working on the problem.\" Then select “High Priority” so &gt; that an Attention/warning icon will appear, and the item will stay &gt; at the top of the display. (Sample wording: Library Search &gt; experiencing problems: We are currently having problems with some &gt; functionality in Library Search. We are working to resolve the &gt; issue. If you receive an error message (such as Application Error) &gt; when searching for books, journal articles, or media, you can &gt; still use the Library &gt; Catalogue &gt; to find your resources. If a Multisearch/Library Search problem, go to the Multisearch Admin &gt; Tool (http://search.lib.sfu.ca:8001/)) and select Notices; either &gt; edit an existing notice or add a new one to have it appear &gt; (prominently!) on the Library Search results pages.
